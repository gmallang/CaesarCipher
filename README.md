# Caesar Cipher

Welcome to the **Caesar Cipher** program! This is a simple text encryption and decryption tool that allows you to apply the classic Caesar Cipher technique to a message.

## Features
- **Encryption and Decryption**: You can encode or decode a message using the Caesar Cipher technique.
- **Shift Mechanism**: The shift value determines how many letters the message will be shifted for encryption or decryption.
- **Replay Option**: After you finish encoding or decoding a message, you can choose to run the program again with a new message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. **Start the Program**: Run the `caesar_cipher.py` file, and the program will start in the terminal.
2. **Choose Action**: You'll be prompted to either **encode** or **decode** a message.
    - Type **`encode`** to encrypt a message.
    - Type **`decode`** to decrypt a message.
3. **Enter the Message**: You'll be prompted to enter the text message you want to encode or decode.
4. **Provide a Shift Number**: Enter a number for the shift (how many letters to move in the alphabet for encryption).
5. **View Result**: The program will output the encrypted or decrypted result based on your inputs.
6. **Replay**: After you finish, you can choose to play again by entering "yes" when asked.
